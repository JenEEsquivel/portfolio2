      <h2>Jennifer's Bio</h2>

      <p>I was born and raised in Wisconsin, but have lived other places, including Central and South America.
      </p>  

      <p>In Costa Rica, I completed my undergrad studies on a full scholarship for an intensive study-abroad program in tropical ecology.  She  returned to start graduate school at UW-Madison in Conservation Geography.  Between my undergraduate and grad studies, I worked in Monteverde as a cloud forest ecotourist guide. 
      </p>  

      <p>I also taught the course "Extinction of Species" at UW-Madison and have worked for the DNR, in both Endangered Resources and Parks.</p> 

      <p>I have managed several internet websites and the portal databases of Forests.org (http://forests.org).  I also helped form several non-profits, worked on websites and served on the board of directors for: Rainforest Biodiversity Group (http://rainforestbiodiversity.org) and Friends of the Wisconsin Wolf (http://fofww.org.)  In volunteering to maintain websites and databases for the non-profits (some that she co-founded), I became more interested in web development.  This interest lead me to the YWeb Career Academy to participate in the web development bootcamp to learn more.  In addition to working in front-end web development and web technology, I intend to create another non-profit and website (in my free time) that connects people around the world with funding for their self-designed conservation projects.
      </p>

      <p>I live with my teenage daughter, two rescue cats and Alfredo--our goldfish mascot.  In my free time, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, reading, learning new things, traveling, surfing (both on the internet and in the Pacific Ocean), snorkeling, hiking and camping.</p>
